# SQL-Portfolio-NBA-Team-Season-By-Season-Stats

This project is based on my favorite sport (basketball) and is used as a deep dive behind the stats that accompany NBA teams from the 2021-2022 and the 2022-2023 NBA season. After every season ends all teams try to make changes that they feel will best improve their team and help them compete for either playoff spots or player development improvements . I have used stats from the seasons of 2022-2023 and 2021-2022 to determine if teams have improved in certain categories such as scoring, assisting, winning games and more.

The objective that I have set for this project is to derive insights that would help evaluate the improvements or deficiencies that have occurred between last season and this season. These findings can be used to determine if their teams have shown improvement between each season or if they have to make significant changes for next season.

I am tasked with:

Performing some exploratory data analysis.
What kind of exploratory analyses on the relevant fields can give more insights about the team's current standing?
What the key statistics that are sepearting winning teams from losing teams?
Extraction of sample data sets using SQL.
Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations.
Cleaning the dataset in Excel.

Main Datasets Analyzed:
